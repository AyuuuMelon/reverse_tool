    Python can have direct access to Qt via PySide2, but this is not always available in
    all RenderDoc builds. To aid extensions to manipulate widgets in a simple but portable fashion this
    helper exposes a small subset of Qt via RenderDoc's python bindings.
    
    The intention is not to allow fully flexible building of Qt panels, but to allow access to some
    basic UI building tools for simple data input and display which can be used on any RenderDoc build.
    
    .. note::
      The widget handles returned are PySide2 widgets where that is available, so this can be used to
      make a basic UI and optionally customise it further with PySide2 when possible.

      Not a member function - the signature for any ``WidgetCallback`` callbacks.

      blank depending on the event, but the context and widget are always valid.

      Not a member function - the signature for any ``InvokeCallback`` callbacks.
    
      Callback for invoking onto the UI thread from another thread (in particular the replay thread).
      Takes no parameters as the callback is expected to store its own state.
