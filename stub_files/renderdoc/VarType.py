    Represents the base type of a shader variable in debugging or constant blocks.
    
    .. data:: Float
    
      A single-precision (32-bit) floating point value.
    
    .. data:: Double
    
      A double-precision (64-bit) floating point value.
    
    .. data:: Half
    
      A half-precision (16-bit) floating point value.
    
    .. data:: SInt
    
      A signed 32-bit integer value.
    
    .. data:: UInt
    
      An unsigned 32-bit integer value.
    
    .. data:: SShort
    
      A signed 16-bit integer value.
    
    .. data:: UShort
    
      An unsigned 16-bit integer value.
    
    .. data:: SLong
    
      A signed 64-bit integer value.

      An unsigned 8-bit integer value.
    
    .. data:: Bool
    
      A boolean value.
    
    .. data:: Enum
    
      An enum - each member gives a named value, and the type itself is stored as an integer.

      A structure with some number of members.

      A 64-bit pointer into GPU-addressable memory. Variables with this type are stored with opaque

      opaque contents and should be decoded with :meth:`ShaderVariable.GetBinding`.

      A reference to a read/write resource bound to the shader. Variables with this type are stored with
      opaque contents and should be decoded with :meth:`ShaderVariable.GetBinding`.
