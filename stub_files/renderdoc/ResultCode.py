    The result from a replay operation such as opening a capture or connecting to
    a remote server.
    
    .. data:: Succeeded
    
      The operation succeeded.
    
    .. data:: UnknownError
    
      An unknown error occurred.
    
    .. data:: InternalError
    
      An internal error occurred indicating a bug or unexpected condition.
    
    .. data:: FileNotFound
    
      The specified file was not found.
    
    .. data:: InjectionFailed
    
      Injection or hooking into the target process failed.
    
    .. data:: IncompatibleProcess
    
      An incompatible process was found, e.g. a 32-bit process with 32-bit support not available.
    
    .. data:: NetworkIOFailed
    
      A network I/O operation failed.
    
    .. data:: NetworkRemoteBusy
    
      The remote side of the network connection was busy.
    
    .. data:: NetworkVersionMismatch
    
      The other side of the network connection was not at a compatible version.
    
    .. data:: FileIOFailed
    
      A filesystem I/O operation failed.
    
    .. data:: FileIncompatibleVersion
    
      The capture file had an incompatible version.
    
    .. data:: FileCorrupted
    
      The capture file is corrupted or otherwise unrecognisable.
    
    .. data:: FileUnrecognised
    
      The file was not recognised as any supported file type.
    
    .. data:: ImageUnsupported
    
      The image file or format is unrecognised or not supported in this form.
    
    .. data:: APIUnsupported
    
      The API used in the capture is not supported.
    
    .. data:: APIInitFailed
    
      The API used in the capture failed to initialise.
    
    .. data:: APIIncompatibleVersion
    
      The API data in the capture had an incompatible version.
    
    .. data:: APIHardwareUnsupported
    
      Current replaying hardware unsupported or incompatible with captured hardware.
    
    .. data:: APIDataCorrupted
    
      While loading the capture for replay, the driver encountered corrupted or invalid serialised data.
    
    .. data:: APIReplayFailed
    
      The API failed to replay the capture, with some runtime error that couldn't be determined until
      the replay began.
    
    .. data:: JDWPFailure
    
      Use of JDWP to launch and inject into the application failed, this most often indicates that some
      other JDWP-using program such as Android Studio is interfering.
    
    .. data:: AndroidGrantPermissionsFailed
    
      Failed to grant runtime permissions when installing Android remote server.
    
    .. data:: AndroidABINotFound

      Couldn't find the folder which contains the Android remote server APK.
    
    .. data:: AndroidAPKInstallFailed
    
      Failed to install Android remote server for unknown reasons.
    
    .. data:: AndroidAPKVerifyFailed
    
      Failed to install Android remote server.

      Data was requested through RenderDoc's API which is not available.
    
    .. data:: InvalidParameter
    
      An invalid parameter was passed to RenderDoc's API.
