      On D3D, a buffer is used as a raw (byte-addressed) buffer.
    
    .. data:: AppendBuffer
    
      On D3D, a buffer is used as a append/consume view.
    
    .. data:: CounterBuffer
    
      On D3D, a buffer is used with a structured buffer with associated hidden counter.
    
    .. data:: ReadOnlyAccess
    
      On GL, a storage image or buffer is bound with read-only access.
    
    .. data:: WriteOnlyAccess
    
      On GL, a storage image or buffer is bound with write-only access.

      for data query purposes during replay), but instead by some virtual or in-line data. For example
      in-line constants set directly, or compile/creation time constants.
    
      The exact nature can be determined by the shader reflection data.
