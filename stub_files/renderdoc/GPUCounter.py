    Pre-defined GPU counters that can be supported by a given implementation.
    
    GPU counters actually available can be queried by :meth:`ReplayController.EnumerateCounters`. If any
    in this list are supported they will be returned with these counter IDs. More counters may be
    enumerated with IDs in the appropriate ranges.
