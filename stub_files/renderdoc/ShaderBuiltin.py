class ShaderBuiltin(__enum.IntEnum):
    """
    Annotates a particular built-in input or output from a shader with a special meaning to
    the hardware or API.
    
    Some of the built-in inputs or outputs can be declared multiple times in arrays or otherwise indexed
    to apply to multiple related things - see :data:`ClipDistance`, :data:`CullDistance` and
    :data:`ColorOutput`.
    
    .. data:: Undefined
    
      Undefined built-in or no built-in is attached to this shader variable.
    
    .. data:: Position
    
      As an output from the final vertex processing shader stage, this feeds the vertex position to the
      rasterized. As an input to the pixel shader stage this receives the position from the rasterizer.
    
    .. data:: PointSize
    
      An output that controls the size of point primitives.
    
    .. data:: ClipDistance
    
      An output for the distance to a user-defined clipping plane. Any pixel with an interpolated value
      that is negative will not be rasterized. Typically there can be more than one such output.
    
    .. data:: CullDistance
    
      An output for the distance to a user-defined culling plane. Any primitive with all vertices having
      negative values will not be rasterized. Typically there can be more than one such output.
    
    .. data:: RTIndex
    
      An output for selecting the render target index in an array to render to. Available in geometry
      shaders and possibly earlier stages depending on hardware/API capability.

      possibly earlier stages depending on hardware/API capability.
    
    .. data:: VertexIndex
    
      An input to the vertex shader listing the vertex index. The exact meaning of this index can vary
      by API but generally it refers to either a 0-based counter for non-indexed draws, or the index
      value for indexed draws. It may or may not be affected by offsets, depending on API semantics.
    
    .. data:: PrimitiveIndex
    
      A built-in indicating which primitive is being processed. This can be read by all primitive stages
      after the vertex shader, and written by the geometry shader.
    
    .. data:: InstanceIndex
    
      This built-in is defined similar to :data:`VertexIndex` but for instances within an instanced
      drawcall. It counts from 0 and as with :data:`VertexIndex` it may or may not be affected by
      drawcall offsets.

    .. data:: GroupSize
    
      The size of a workgroup, giving the number of threads in each dimension.
    
    .. data:: GroupFlatIndex
    
      An input in compute shaders giving a flat 1D index of the thread within the current workgroup.

      dimension.
    
    .. data:: GroupThreadIndex
    
      An input in compute shaders giving a 3D index of this thread within its workgroup, up to the
      workgroup size.
    
      The input does not vary between one thread in a workgroup and the same thread in another
      workgroup.

      An input to the pixel shader indicating whether or not the contributing triangle was considered
      front-facing or not according to the API setup for winding order and backface orientation.

      outer edge of each primitive is tessellated by the fixed-function tessellator.
    
      It is also available for reading in the tessellation evaluation or domain shader.

      level inside the primitive.
    
    .. data:: ColorOutput
    
      An output from the pixel shader, this determines the color value written to the corresponding
